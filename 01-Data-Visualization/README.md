Data Visualization Syllabus
=======
**Course Description**
Data Visualization is a course that teaches how to create visualizations that effectively communicate the meaning behind data to an observer through visual perception. We will learn how a computer displays information using computer graphics, and how the human perceives that information visually. We will also study the forms of data, including quantitative and non-quantitative data, and how they are properly mapped to the elements of a visualization to be perceived well by the observer. We will briefly overview some design elements for effective visualization, though we will not focus on the visual design needed to make attractive and artistic visualizations. This course does not require computer programming, but computer programming can be used to complete the exercises. The course will conclude with the integration of visualization into database and data-mining systems to provide support for decision making, and the effective construction of a visualization dashboard.
